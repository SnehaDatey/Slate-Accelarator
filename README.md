# Slate-Accelarator
During my React training, I worked on a company project where I implemented login and signup functionality using a token-based authentication system with a live API. I learned how to send headers in API requests and manage data fetching using axios. Additionally, I developed features to add and update candidate data through the live API. I also gained experience in securely storing tokens in local storage and using them across the entire project for authenticated actions.
